    higi Service. It typically takes about one month to delete an account and all associated information, but some information may remain in backup copies and
    logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. We wait 90 days before permanently deleting
    your account information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information. Please note, certain data you have provided may
    continue to exist in aggregate form that cannot be used to identify you.
