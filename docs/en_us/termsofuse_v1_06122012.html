<p><strong>9. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Interpreting the Contract.</strong> All provisions of these Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of the Terms of Use as written, you and we will replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of the Terms of Use will remain unchanged. This is the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service. It supersedes any prior agreement or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Service. If you have confidentiality obligations related to the Service (<em>e.g.</em>, as a beta tester), those obligations remain. Other terms may apply when you use or pay for other higi services. The section titles included within the Terms of Use do not limit its terms.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 Assignment.</strong> We may assign transfer, or otherwise dispose our rights and obligations under the Terms of Use, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. You may not assign or transfer any rights to use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>9.3 No Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> These Terms of Use are solely for your and our benefit. It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors.</p>
<p><strong>9.4 Claims.</strong> Claims must be filed within one year. You must bring any claim related to this contract or the service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims. If it isn't filed on time, the claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>9.5 Notices.</strong> You may notify us as stated in the customer support or "help" area for the service. The Terms of Use are in electronic form. We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide. <strong>We provide required information to you by e-mail at the e-mail address you specified when you signed up for your Service or by access to a higi website that we identify. Notices emailed to you will be deemed given and received when the email is sent.</strong> If you don't consent to receive notices electronically, you must stop using the Service.</p>
<p><strong>10. APPLICABLE LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>This Service and these Terms of Use (including without limitation the validity, construction and performance of duties related to the Terms of Use) is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. We make no representation that materials or services included within the Service are appropriate or available for use outside the United States, and access to them from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited. Venue with respect to any dispute (not subject to arbitration as provided below) between you and higi will rest exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois unless such venue would deprive you of any remedy, at law or in equity, which would otherwise be available in your state of residence.</p>
<p>You shall first contact us at <strong>support@higi.com</strong>regarding any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, or any breach thereof, or the use of the Service (including the site and the higi Stations, and higi&rsquo;s privacy and security practices or adherence or non-adherence to its Privacy Policy with respect to the Service, the site or the higi Stations), except such claims or controversies for which injunctive relief is available, that cannot be resolved by mediation within 30 days shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&rdquo;), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You agree that, by accepting these Terms of Use, you and higi are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.</p>
<p>Unless you and higi agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence. If the claim or controversy is for $10,000 or less, higi agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator(s), through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the claim or controversy exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons upon which the award is based.</p>
