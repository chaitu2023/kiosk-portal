    <strong>VI. </strong>
    <strong>Rewards Program</strong>
</p>
    <p>
    
   When you create a higi account, you will be enrolled in our rewards and loyalty program (“Rewards Program”) which promotes healthy activities and behaviors both offline and online through distribution of higi Points.  The Rewards Program is offered in conjunction with our Rewards Partners who provide and/or honor higi Rewards.  The specific laws, rules, and regulations governing certain promotions or contests through the Rewards Programs may vary, and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those laws, rules, and regulations.
</p>
    <p>
    “<strong>higi Points</strong>” represent a point value awarded for qualifying exercise and other behavior offered by higi as a Reward earning opportunity. Your higi account will maintain a record of your accrued balance of higi Points as well as any account credits and debits.  higi Points are, at all times, the property of higi.  higi Points are not transferable and cannot be combined with higi Points from another user’s account unless specifically made available to you under certain conditions that are set by higi.  higi Points are not redeemable for cash or any other form of currency or credit and have no fixed or ascertainable cash value.  
</p>

<p>
“<strong>Rewards</strong>” are issued by our Rewards Partners and may be tendered to you in the form of electronic promotion codes, offline reward mailers, goods, services, or a combination of these means or in gift certificate format by the Rewards Partner or by higi.  You may receive Rewards by redeeming higi Points as per the terms and conditions described at [http://higi.com/reward/preview] for each Rewards Partner and/or subject to specific conditions that are set in the sole discretion of higi and that may be adjusted by higi at any time. Rewards offered are subject to change from time to time at the discretion of the Reward Partner and/or higi, and specific Rewards are not guaranteed to be available at all times. 
</p>

<p>
“<strong>Rewards Partners</strong>” are entities and individuals, which may include brands, manufacturers, retailers, and other third parties, that provide and/or honor higi Rewards.  The list of participating Rewards Partners is subject to change at any time.  <strong>Rewards</strong> Partners are not agents, employees, contractors, partners, or subcontractors of higi. Participation by any Reward Partner should not be taken as an endorsement, either express or implied, of the Rewards Partner or its products or services by higi or any of the companies that provide exercise tracking technologies. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eligibility</strong>. To participate in the higi Rewards Program or to accrue additional higi Points, your higi account must be in good standing. A higi account will be in “good standing” if you (i) have registered and accepted these Terms, (ii) have not terminated your participation in the Rewards Program, (iii) have not been determined by higi to have engaged in any practices deliberately conducted in an attempt to accrue and/or redeem higi Points in any way inconsistent with the rules or intent of the higi Rewards Program, (iv) have either earned or redeemed higi Points in the previous twelve (12) months, and (v) are not in default under these Terms.  If your account ceases to be in good standing, you have twelve (12) months from the data your account ceased to be in good standing to redeem higi Points, after which you will forfeit all remaining accrued higi Points. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Redeeming higi Points for Rewards</strong>.  Provided that your account is in good standing, you may redeem higi Points for Rewards through the higi Service, subject to the following conditions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Rewards (and, if applicable, their use) are subject to (i) availability, (ii) terms and conditions specified by the Rewards Partners and/or as listed on the actual Rewards, including expiration dates, and (iii) may be subject to change at any time.</li>
    
<li>higi shall determine the total number of higi Points that you must redeem to obtain a Reward and may change the amount of higi Points required to redeem a Reward at any time, with or without notice. Some offers may be a onetime offer per participant.  Offers vary from time to time and availability may be highly limited.</li>

<li>Rewards Partners or higi may, in their sole discretion, choose to offer Rewards to select groups or individual participants.</li>

<li>There may be instances in which you are asked for certain information in order to redeem a Reward with a certain Rewards Partner; if you decline to answer a request for such information, you may forfeit your ability to receive that particular Reward.</li>

<li>In the event a Rewards Partner refuses to honor a Reward for any reason, higi’s sole obligation will be to credit your account for the number of higi Points that were to be redeemed for the Reward.</li>

<li>Except as expressly stated in these Terms, Rewards cannot be returned, exchanged, refunded, or replaced by cash, higi Points, or other Rewards.</li>

<li>You must promptly notify higi of (i) any discrepancy in the Rewards; or (ii) non-receipt of Rewards shipment.  Upon receipt of such notification, higi will investigate and may, if appropriate, (a) correct such discrepancies; or (ii) replace any non-received Reward, provided that, if requested by higi, you submit a properly completed Affidavit of Lost Shipment within thirty (30) days of the shipment date.  If higi does not receive such notification or Affidavit within thirty (30) days, the shipment will be deemed to be satisfactory and accepted by you.</li>

<li>You are responsible for any fees, taxes, and charges for any personal or corporate state, federal, or provincial tax liabilities, if any, related to your participation in the higi Rewards Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Accuracy of higi Points</strong>.  higi will use reasonable efforts to accurately account for accrual and redemption of higi Points.  higi reserves the right (i) to audit your account at any time for compliance with these Terms, without notice to you, and (ii) to change accrued higi Points totals without notification if such audit reveals errors, inaccuracies, miscalculations, or noncompliance.  If you become aware of any discrepancy in your higi Points balances, accruals, redemptions, or calculations, you must promptly notify higi, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after your account balance changes as a result of a transaction.  Otherwise, higi Points calculations will be deemed accurate, and you waive any claim for future adjustment or adjudication. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modification and Interpretation of Rewards Program</strong>. Higi may modify, cancel, or terminate the Rewards Program’s rules, processes, regulations, Rewards Partners, Rewards, and special offers at any time, with or without notice.  All interpretations of the Rewards Program rules and terms provided are made at the sole discretion of higi.  higi may: (i) change the amount of higi Points in any account; (ii) change the number of higi Points required to redeem a Reward; (iii) impose caps and/or fees on higi Points earnings and/or on the redemption of higi Points; or (iv) change the list of Rewards available. Your continued participation in the higi Rewards Program after any posted modification of the Rewards Program in these Terms indicates your acceptance of the modification.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Name and Value of Rewards Program Currency</strong>. higi reserves the right in its sole discretion to change the name of its Rewards Program currency from higi Points or to add additional currencies to the Rewards Program at any time, without prior notice. higi also reserves the right to determine the value of any new currency as compared to higi Points and to automatically convert your current higi Points to any new currency.

    The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong><u>DMCA</u></strong>”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material
    appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the higi Service infringe
    your copyright, you (or your agent) may send higi a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it
    blocked. The notice must include the following information:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
</li>
<li>
    Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the higi Service are covered by a
    single notification, a representative list of such works);
</li>
<li>
    Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow
    higi to locate the material on the higi Service;
</li>
<li>
    Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
</li>
<li>
    A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent,
    or the law; and
</li>
<li>
    A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on
    behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
    If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send higi a
    counter-notice.
</p>
<p>
    Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices
    and counter-notices with respect to the higi Service should be sent to higi SH llc, 150 N. Wacker Dr. Suite 1120, Chicago, IL 60606 (support@higi.com). Consult your
    legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
