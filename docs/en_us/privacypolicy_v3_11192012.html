<p>
    <strong>No Personal Information from Children</strong>
    <br/>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Children are not permitted to
    use the Service, and we request that
    children under the age of 13 not submit any personal information to the Service. Since information regarding

    higi does not knowingly distribute personal information regarding children under the age of 13. For additional
    information, please refer to the
    &#8220;Children and Parents&#8221; section below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Visibility of Your Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
    <br/>
    We may provide users with the ability to search for other users of the Service. Utilizing such search functionality,
    other users may be able to view
    certain information about you, including your first name, the first initial of your last name, city and state and
    photo, to the extent you have provided
    such information (collectively, your &#8220;<strong>Public Profile</strong>&#8221;). Information included within
    your Public Profile is information you
    have chosen to make public, and therefore will be viewed by others, so you need to consider carefully whether you
    are comfortable sharing such information.
    At your request, your Public Profile may be designated &#8220;unsearchable,&#8221; and no longer appear in search
    results returned by the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may correct,
    update, amend, delete or remove it or
    deactivate or delete your account by making the change in your profile settings or by sending us an email to <strong>support@higi.com</strong>. Deactivating your account puts your account on hold.
    Deactivating an account is the same as you
    telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the
    future. When you delete an account, you are
    requesting that your account and the information stored therein be permanently deleted from higi. It typically takes
    about one month to delete an account
    and all associated information, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You
    should only delete your account if you are
    sure you never want to reactivate it. We wait 90 days before permanently deleting your account information in order
    to help avoid accidental or malicious
    removal of your information.
    <strong>
        Please note, certain data you have provided may continue to exist in Aggregate Data Sets; however, we will
        undertake to first remove data that can be
        used to personally identify you. For additional information, please refer to the &#8220;Aggregate Data Sets&#8221;
        section below.
