<p><strong>higi Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for reviewing our Privacy Policy. The higi service, accessible at various higi Stations and online at <strong>www.higi.com</strong> (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), is operated from the United States of America on behalf of higi, llc ("<strong>higi,</strong>" "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>" and "<strong>our</strong>"). It is our policy to protect your personal information and to use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only governs our use and disclosure of information collected through the Service. It does not apply to data collected through other online or offline higi sites, products or services that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or that have their own privacy statements.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The Service includes a personal information platform that lets you gather, edit, store and share information online. Please review the <strong>Terms of Use</strong> for complete information regarding the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong><br />Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We want you to understand what information we collect from you when you use the Service and whether and to whom we share such information with others. Using the Service is voluntary, and by accessing or using the Service, you: acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy; agree that your access and use of the Service are subject to the Privacy Policy; and consent to our collection and use of your Non-Personal and Personally Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy, as updated or revised from time to time. At all times, we reserve the right to disclose any information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; to protect higi&rsquo;s rights or property (including without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of the company, or substantially all of its assets), or during emergencies when safety is at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br />When you use the Service, several types of data may be collected from you, including: (1) Non-Personal Information; and (2) Personally Identifiable Information. We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><br />We receive data about you whenever you interact with higi, such as when you visit the site, look at another person&rsquo;s profile, or search for a friend or a page. We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access the Service. This may include your IP address, location, the type of browser you use, or the pages you visit. We receive data whenever you visit a program that sends data to higi. This may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address or URL you&rsquo;re on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you&rsquo;re logged in to the Service, your user login.</p>
<p>This information (collectively, "<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>") does not, by itself, personally identify users. We use this Non-Personal Information to monitor the effectiveness of the Service, to help personalize your online experience and to consider potential improvements to the Service. Non-Personal Information may be collected through cookies. For more detailed information on cookies, please refer to the &ldquo;Use of Cookies&rdquo; section below.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br />By using the Service, we may collect information that, either alone or in combination with other information, can be used to uniquely identify, contact or locate you (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>PII</strong>&rdquo;). The PII collected may include, without limitation, contact information, such as your name and email address, as well as any other PII you choose to upload. By providing such information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Account Information</strong><br />Access to certain portions of the Service requires login and password information provided only to users who have registered (each a &ldquo;<strong>Registered User</strong>&rdquo;). You choose whether to create an account with the Service. As part of the registration process, you may be asked to provide your email address or register using your Facebook sign-in credentials, as described below. Currently, you can review and update your email address. In the near future, we may provide users with the ability to modify, add or delete any other account information by signing into your higi account and editing your account profile.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Social Networks</strong><br />The Service also currently accepts Facebook sign-in credentials to enable you to register as a user of the Service. By accessing the Service with your Facebook credentials, you authorize us to recognize you based on your Facebook sign-in credentials and to collect certain information from Facebook, which will include: your name, date of birth, gender, email address, city, state, biography and photo (to the extent this information is included within your Facebook account). We do not issue Facebook credentials, and do not endorse any third-party credential provider. Before you choose to use Facebook sign-in credentials with the Service, we recommend that you evaluate the security and privacy commitments offered by the issuer and decide if they are appropriate for your higi account.</p>
<p><strong>Health Metrics</strong><br />By accessing the Service through higi Stations, you may elect to have certain health metrics about you, which may include: weight, blood pressure, pulse and BMI (body mass index), measured at the higi Station, and collected and transmitted to and stored on-line in your personal account.</p>
<p><strong>No Personal Information from Children</strong><br />We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Children are not permitted to use the Service, and we request that children under the age of 13 not submit any personal information to the Service. Since information regarding children under the age of 13 is not collected, higi does not knowingly distribute personal information regarding children under the age of 13. For additional information, please refer to the &ldquo;Children and Parents&rdquo; section below.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility of Your Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br />In the near future, we may provide users with the ability to search for other users of the Service. Utilizing such search functionality, other users may be able to view certain information about you, including your first name, the first initial of your last name, city and state and photo, to the extent you have provided such information (collectively, your &ldquo;<strong>Public Profile</strong>&rdquo;). Information included within your Public Profile may be personal or sensitive, so you need to consider carefully whether you are comfortable sharing such information. At your request, your Public Profile may be designated &ldquo;unsearchable,&rdquo; and no longer appear in search results returned by the Service.</p>
<p>You may deactivate or delete your higi account at anytime by sending us an email to <strong>support@higi.com</strong>. Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future. When you delete an account, you are requesting that your account and the information stored therein be permanently deleted from higi. It typically takes about one month to delete an account and all associated information, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. We wait 90 days before permanently deleting your account information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information. <strong>Please note, certain data you have provided may continue to exist in Aggregate Data Sets; however, we will undertake to first remove data that can be used to personally identify you. For additional information, please refer to the &ldquo;Aggregate Data Sets&rdquo; section below. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Use of Your Information</strong><br />We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you. For example, we may use the information we receive about you as part of our efforts to keep higi safe and secure, including critical updates and notifications, and to send you the higi e-mail newsletter.</p>
<p>Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide higi as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways. <strong>While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your personally identifiable information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others (except our employees, agents or affiliates in connection with providing you the Service) unless: we have received your permission; given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of Non-Personal Information</strong><br />We use the Non-Personal Information collected through the Service for statistical purposes and for improving the functionality of the Service. This information may also be used to administer your participation in the Service including, without limitation, to troubleshoot and resolve problems with the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br />We use PII collected through the Service for purposes of creating and maintaining your higi account, customizing your user experience, providing relevant information, and communicating with you regarding our services. To keep you informed of the latest improvements, the Service will send you a newsletter. If you do not want to receive the newsletter, unsubscribe at any time by simply clicking the 'unsubscribe' link that we include at the bottom of every email that we send you. The Service will also send you an email summarizing recent account activity. If you do not want to receive these emails, you can unsubscribe at any time. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Aggregate Data Sets</strong><br />We may use your PII (which has been anonymized) to create aggregate data sets. This aggregated information is not associated with any individual account. higi may use aggregated information from the Service to improve the quality of the Service, for marketing of the Service (for example, to tell potential advertisers how many Service users live in the United States), and for public health and research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures of Your Information</strong><br />We may disclose your information to other higi users in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For more information on such disclosures, see the &ldquo;Visibility of Your Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; section above.</p>
<p>We may, on occasion, hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf. In those limited cases, we give those companies only the personal information they need to deliver the service, such as IP address or e-mail address. higi&rsquo;s practice is to require the companies to maintain the confidentiality of the information and to prohibit them from using the information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, disclosure of your information to third parties may occur in other situations such as: (i) responding to a subpoena, court order or other such request; (ii) responding to a law enforcement agency's request or as otherwise required by law; and (iii) providing information to a third party if we file for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership in connection with proposed or consummated corporate reorganizations, such as mergers, acquisitions, or sales of business units. In all such instances, we will take the utmost care to disclose only that information which is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br />We strive to maintain the security of your information by using reasonable and appropriate technical, physical and administrative safeguards. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that is disclosed online. Consequently, we do not insure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br />Cookies are small bits of data cached or stored on your computer based on Internet activity. We may use cookies to monitor individual activity in aggregate to improve the Service and provide features that are tailored to your needs, including delivery of customized content and advertising. The information we gather may include IP address, user language, the operating system, browser type, the presence/absence of &ldquo;flash&rdquo; plug-ins, screen resolution, connection type, and information that identifies the cookie. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent this. If you disable cookies, your ability to use some features of the Service may be limited.</p>
<p>We also use session cookies when you use the Service. Session cookies are active only during the period you are logged on to the Service, and are removed when you leave. They help us track the sections of the Service that you use to allow us to make improvements in keeping with observed user preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Sites</strong><br />We may provide links to other third party websites on the Service solely as a convenience to you. However, such linking does not mean, and should not be interpreted to mean, that higi endorses, is affiliated with or makes any representations concerning such third party websites. We neither review, nor control, nor are responsible for these third party sites or any content therein. By using these links, you will leave the Service. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this Service, you do so entirely at your own risk. We shall not be liable for any consequences arising from use of the third-party sites referenced above or any other third party websites to which the Service links.</p>
<p><strong>Children and Parents</strong><br />Use of the Service is not offered to children. If you are under 13, you may not use the Service. We do not intend to collect personal information from children. Parents and guardians are advised that any personal information voluntarily entered by children may be available for public access. If your child has submitted personal information, please contact us to request that such information be removed. Once we are aware of information entered by a child, we will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to remove such information from our databases and storage areas; however, we are not liable for any consequences relating to such information.</p>
<p><strong>Modifications to the Privacy Policy</strong><br />It may be necessary for us to modify this Privacy Policy. We will notify all users by posting an amended version of the Privacy Policy on the Service. Such modifications will become effective on the day they are posted.
